## Project Idea
First of all the *Question Generator* shall be a supporting project of our term project, since we need questions to make a quiz game out of it. 

The users shall be able to log in into the application and add questions to their game.
They can have one or more questionnaires and each of the questionnaire can have a different set of questions.
The game supports different types of questions which need different input. For example there can be questions for a hiding game and for a buzzer-game. 
The hiding game would need one wrong answer and the buzzer game only one right answer.

For one question the user shall add at least 4 answers. For each answer they can also upload an image which can be used in the game instead of the text on it's own.

The questions then should be saved in a CMS.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
